# Green Manure Thesis Data Analysis

This repository contains all the data and analyses used in my Master's Project, excluding 16s data [which can be found here](https://github.com/alyssa-daigle/GM-16s-QIIME2).

## Expt 1: Microcosm Experiment & Expt 2: Greenhouse Experiment

Both folders contain the following:

-   **R** folder contains the scripts for data analysis AND plotting

-   **data** folder contains all the csvs used in the scripts

-   **globals.R** contains all packages necessary for the analyses

-   **thesis_theme.R** contains all the themes used in plotting

To use this repo, you will need to use the **config_paths_template.R** file as a template to update your own variables (where your directories/data will be). Make one for BOTH the Expt 1 and Expt 1 sub directories.
